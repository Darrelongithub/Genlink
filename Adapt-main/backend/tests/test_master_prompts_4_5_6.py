"""Master prompts 4, 5 and 6 -- curation, the retention check, and the script.

Same join as prompt 3's tests pin: the exact strings from the six-prompt set live
in code, every path that serves the learner carries the prompt's output contract
whether or not a model is configured, and a model's contribution is refused
wholesale when it breaks the shape -- most importantly, a curator may only cite
results it was actually handed, and the check's rationale carries the *measured*
timing rather than a quote from a textbook.
