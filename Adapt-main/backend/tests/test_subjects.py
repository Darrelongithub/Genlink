"""The subject round (round brief §6): the claims, tested.

Six agents share this repository and this one owns the subject round, so these tests are that
round's floor: each claim §6 makes, turned into something that fails when the claim stops being
true.

* §6.2 — the skill sets are versioned code constants, and every skill says what it measures, what
  one ~40-second game measures it with, and what a branch decision needs from it
  (``test_every_skill_says_what_it_measures_and_how_it_is_measured``).
* §6.3 — the eleven named topics have *written-down* ratings; a topic nobody wrote ratings for is
  rated from the generic profile and **labelled as such**; a model's answer is schema-checked
  against the taxonomy before a single skill is chosen
  (``test_the_eleven_brief_topics_have_authored_ratings``,
  ``test_a_topic_nobody_authored_falls_back_to_the_generic_profile_and_says_so``,
  ``test_a_model_answer_is_checked_against_the_taxonomy_before_it_is_used``).
* The plan shows its working: which skills, why those, and every skill it did *not* test recorded as
  ``not_measured`` — never as a zero
  (``test_calculus_and_government_are_given_visibly_different_tests_and_both_say_why``,
  ``test_a_skipped_skill_has_no_score_at_all``, ``test_every_authored_topic_leaves_something_unmeasured``).
* §6.4 — the staircase as properties over *every* answer sequence a ladder can be given: monotone up,
  terminating inside the item cap, descending the prerequisite chain on a low failure, and bottoming
  out for a true beginner
  (``test_an_all_correct_climb_never_goes_down_a_rung``,
  ``test_every_answer_sequence_terminates_inside_the_item_cap``,
  ``test_a_failure_at_rung_one_or_two_drops_down_the_prerequisite_chain``,
  ``test_a_true_beginner_bottoms_out_at_rung_zero_or_a_root_prerequisite``,
  ``test_the_ladder_rotates_and_stops_after_three_reversals``).
* §6.5 — the pop-up lesson is counterbalanced by a seeded step in code, both legs ask the same
  question format, and the gain is measured against what was *expected* of this learner rather than
  against a raw score
  (``test_the_counterbalance_covers_every_cell_and_both_orders``,
  ``test_the_gain_is_measured_against_expected_performance_not_raw_scores``,
  ``test_an_unanswered_lesson_is_not_a_tie_and_not_a_preference``).
* The HTTP surface answers in the house error shape, a run that is not yours does not exist, and a
  sealed round refuses further answers
  (``test_the_brief_endpoints_answer_over_http``, ``test_another_learner_s_run_does_not_exist``,
  ``test_a_sealed_round_refuses_further_answers``, ``test_refused_input_is_422_in_the_house_shape``).
* And the round writes into the shared store as ``code`` — evidence, never a learner model, which is
  not this module's to write
  (``test_a_finished_round_lands_in_the_shared_evidence_log``,
  ``test_the_round_writes_evidence_and_never_the_learner_model``).

Run: ``pytest -q tests/test_subjects.py``.
