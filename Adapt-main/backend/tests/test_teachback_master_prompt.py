"""Master prompt 3 -- the teach-back grader -- pinned, wired, and gated.

The six master prompts shipped with the web-application prompt set
(``adapt-web-application-prompts.zip`` at the repository root) describe one
prompt per AI surface. Number 3 is the teach-back judge:

    grade a "teach-back" (explain it in your own words) for conceptual correctness
    and clarity -- never phrasing or grammar -- be generous with partial credit for
    partially correct mental models, flag clear misconceptions, and always answer
    with strict JSON ``{score, feedback (<=220 chars, second person, kind and
    specific), misconceptions}``.

This repo's grader is rule-first (``adapt.assessment.teachback``): the model is a
second reader whose checklist is only accepted when every met point carries a
verbatim quote. What these tests pin is the *join* of the two: the exact prompt
lives in code, every grading path -- model or no model -- returns the three
learner-facing fields, and the model's presence never lets it invent a score.
