"""Concepts of any subject, taught three ways, and an approved visual that actually shows up.

Two defects live in this file.

**The visual strategy changed nothing.** ``visual_representation`` was in the catalogue,
had a mechanism, had citations — and approving it altered the screen not at all, because
the only drawable things were four hand-authored specs on four maths items. Here: approving
it moves every served question onto a generic template filled from that concept's own
material, and the templates are the four structural ones (flow, comparison table, timeline,
labelled diagram) — not subject-specific drawings.

**There was one paragraph per topic and a maths-only bank.** For any subject, a concept now
offers three versions of itself (text, visual, worked example) and a matched pair of
questions, and the answer key is checked by *quotability from the source* rather than by
arithmetic — so a history or biology item can pass the same rulebook, and anything that
cannot be checked is reported as unverified instead of being served as if it had been.
