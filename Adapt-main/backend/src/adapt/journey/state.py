"""Reading and writing the path's state, server-side.

The API surface is two calls (frozen in the shared header):

* :func:`payload` — ``GET /api/v1/journey`` (and ``GET /api/v1/journey/state``)
  answers ``{stage, stages: [{id, status}]}``.
* :func:`advance` — ``POST /api/v1/journey/advance`` records the learner's own
  answer about one stage, ``done`` or ``skipped``.

Everything else is derivation, and the derivation is deliberately boring: one query
per stage, answered from the row that proves the work happened. Where a stored answer
and the evidence disagree, **the evidence wins** — a learner who skipped the games and
then played them has played them, and a status that kept saying "skipped" would be the
app arguing with its own database.

Two rules the rest of the app depends on:

1. **Skipped means not measured.** A skipped stage contributes no value anywhere; the
   snapshot, the subject map and the profile already phrase an absent measurement as
   "not measured" and this module does not add a zero to any of them.
2. **Resumable from any device.** The state lives on the learner's row, so the same
   browser, a second laptop and the phone all read the same answer. Nothing in this
   module reads a cookie, a session or a client-supplied cursor.
