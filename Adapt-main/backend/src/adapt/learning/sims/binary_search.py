"""Binary search, as a trace of decisions rather than as code.

The point of the animation is not "the answer is index 7"; it is that *every* comparison
throws away half of what is left, and that this only works because the list is sorted. So
each frame records the range still in play, what was discarded, and -- in ``cause`` -- the
reason, which is what makes "why did we throw the left half away?" answerable without a
model call.

The input is asserted, never repaired: an unsorted or duplicated list would make the
animation show a wrong algorithm, so :func:`run` refuses it and the validator in
:mod:`adapt.learning.scenespec` is what turns a learner's edit into a legal list.
