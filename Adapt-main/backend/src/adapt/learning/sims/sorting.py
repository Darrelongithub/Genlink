"""Insertion sort, frame by frame, with the comparisons counted as they happen.

Learners usually mis-train this animation by watching the swaps without seeing the
*scan*: the interesting part is that the sorted prefix is searched from the right, and
that a value moves only while it is bigger than the target. So every shift frame states
which two values were compared and what was found, and the ``cause`` on the frame is what
"why did it move that far?" is answered from.
