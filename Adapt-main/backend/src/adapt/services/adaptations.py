"""The approval gate -- the only place a persistent adaptation may be written.

Blueprint §3: *AI 1 never applies a persistent change on its own.* That rule is
worth less than a comment unless it is enforceable, so it is enforced here in two
ways:

* :func:`approve` requires ``student_decision`` -- an explicit record of the
  learner's answer to a specific proposal, including *when*. It then writes the
  ``ActiveAdaptation`` row that AI 2 reads. No other module imports
  ``ActiveAdaptation`` for writing, and ``tests/test_adaptation_gate.py`` asserts
  that by scanning AI 1's source for construction of that model.
* ``modify`` cannot smuggle in a new strategy: the student may change the knobs of
  the proposed action, and anything else they typed is stored as a *stated
  preference* (which is theirs to ask for) rather than as an approved adaptation.

Rejecting is not discarded either: it is recorded, because "this learner said no to
hint fading" is evidence about them and it stops AI 1 proposing the same thing
tomorrow.
