"""Application services: the wiring between the two AIs, the store, and the API.

Architectural rule the blueprint asks for and this module makes concrete: **AI 1 and
AI 2 do not talk to each other.** They share the SQLite database and nothing else.
AI 1 writes traces, evidence, hypotheses and proposals; AI 2 reads the profile plus
the *approved* adaptations table. A message bus between them would let one AI's
transient reasoning leak into the other's teaching, and would make it impossible to
answer "what exactly did AI 2 know when it decided this?" -- the DB row can.

:func:`build` returns one :class:`AppServices` object that owns the engine, the two
AIs, the resource service, the rate limiter and the voice backends, so the FastAPI
app, the CLI and the tests all construct the system the same way.
