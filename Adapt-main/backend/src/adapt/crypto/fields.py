"""Column-level encryption for learner data.

This layer is always on (unless ``ADAPT_DB_ENCRYPTION=off``, which the app warns
about and refuses to use when a learner record exists), *in addition to*
SQLCipher file encryption. Rationale: the blueprint says "SQLite does not
provide encryption by default, so an actual encryption implementation must be
selected" -- we select both, because SQLCipher needs a native driver that may be
absent on the demo machine, while AES-GCM column encryption is pure
``cryptography`` and keeps learner free text (answers, transcripts, profile
notes) confidential in every mode.

Format: ``b"AGC1" || nonce(12) || ciphertext||tag`` with the column name as
additional authenticated data, so a ciphertext cannot be moved between columns.
