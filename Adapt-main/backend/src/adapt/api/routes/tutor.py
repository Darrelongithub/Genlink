"""AI 2's teaching surface: answers, hints, examples, resources, materials.

Note what is *not* here: no endpoint that changes a persistent strategy. "Explain it
more simply" is an in-the-moment request and is executed immediately -- the approval
gate exists for changes the app keeps making after the screen is closed, not for
asking a question. The distinction is the blueprint's, and it is the reason the demo
does not need a consent form to say "please try a diagram".
