"""Choosing the tests for a topic: the top leanings, one cross-check, a time cap, and honest
"not measured" states for everything else (§6.3 step 2).

This is the code half of "the AI proposes, code decides". A rating table arrives (authored, or a
model's, already validated against the taxonomy) and this module turns it into a round a learner can
actually sit: four skills, about three minutes, and a list of what was *not* measured.

Three rules are load-bearing:

* **A skipped skill is never zero.** §6.3 says it plainly and the failure it prevents is real: a
  plan that left untested skills out of the response would be read as "you have no number sense",
  and a plan that scored them 0 would put a false number in the learner model. Every skill the round
  did not reach comes back with ``status="not_measured"`` and the reason it was skipped, and
  :func:`TestPlan.as_dict` puts them in the same list shape as the tested ones so no screen can
  render one without the other.
* **The cross-check is reserved, not ranked last.** §2 requires code to "keep the minimum
  cross-check", so when the time cap bites it is the *leaned* skills that get cut. A round that
  measured the same mechanic four times would look thorough and would not be able to falsify itself.
* **The cross-check never tests a skill the topic does not lean on.** Rating ≥ 2 is the floor. The
  brief's own example is "for government, argument, sources and perspective are tested; number sense
  is not" — testing something the topic does not need spends the learner's minutes and produces a
  number nobody will act on.
