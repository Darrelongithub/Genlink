"""The authored topic table: which subject family a topic belongs to, and how much it leans on
each skill (round brief §6.3).

§6.3 is explicit that pre-written ratings exist in code for the common topics and that **the model
only fills gaps**. That order is the whole point: an authored rating is a claim a person made and
can be argued with, a model rating is a sample, and a placement round that changes shape between
two learners who both typed "calculus" is not a measurement instrument.

So this file is the authored half. Ratings are 0–3 (:data:`adapt.subjects.leanings.LEANING_SCALE`),
over the skill ids in :mod:`adapt.subjects.taxonomy`, and they are stored with the taxonomy version
they were written against.

Two authoring rules worth knowing before editing a number:

* **Leave something unselected.** The round tests the top three or four leanings plus one
  cross-check under a time cap, and §6.3 requires every skipped skill to be recorded as
  *not measured* rather than zero. A topic whose ratings are all 3 would test everything, which
  sounds generous and actually means the round measured nothing selectively — and the learner spent
  twice as long. Each table below leaves at least one skill at 1 or 2.
* **A cross-family rating is allowed and is a claim.** ``essay_writing`` really does lean on
  ``hist.argument``: supporting a claim with evidence is the same skill in a language class and a
  civics class. Ratings are validated against the whole skill list, not just the family's, so this
  is expressible — and the plan shows it with the family named, so it does not look like a bug.
