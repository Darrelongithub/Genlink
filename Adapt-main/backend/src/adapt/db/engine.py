"""Engine + session factory with encryption-at-rest policy applied.

Verified in-repo (see ``adapt doctor`` and tests/test_encryption.py):

* With SQLCipher 4 the database file header is ciphertext and opening it with
  plain ``sqlite3`` raises ``DatabaseError: file is not a database``.
* Column-level AES-256-GCM (``crypto/fields.py``) protects learner free text in
  every mode, so a fallback to plain SQLite is never "unencrypted learner text".
