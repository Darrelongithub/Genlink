"""which class of work each call was, and how much of it the cache served

Revision ID: 0010
Revises: 0009
Create Date: 2026-10-14 10:20:00.000000

Adds the two columns the cost round needs to be *checkable* rather than believed:

* ``llm_calls.tier`` -- the class of work (``ai/routing.py``) a call was routed as. Written
  per call, because the routing table is meant to change: "we moved the retention question to
  the quick class last week and the daily call count halved" is a claim that needs the old
  rows to still say what they were.
* ``llm_calls.cached_tokens`` -- input tokens the provider served from a registered static
  prefix. This is a saving, not a cost, and it is the only honest answer to "did caching earn
  its place on this deployment" (a cache that is created and never hit shows as created=1,
  reused=0).

Both are nullable/defaulted so existing rows stay valid without a data migration: they
predate the routing table and were, by definition, not served from a cache.

Existence-aware in both directions, like ``0003`` and ``0004``: a fresh clone gets its schema
from ``Base.metadata.create_all``, which already builds these columns, and the documented
``stamp 0002 && upgrade head`` recovery path replays every revision after it -- so without the
check the recovery step would end in ``duplicate column name``.
