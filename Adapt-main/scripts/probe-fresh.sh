#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Run the UI probe against a freshly started API and web server.
#
# Why fresh servers: the rate-limit buckets live in the API *process*, and the probe is a
# whole term's worth of traffic in a few seconds. Reusing one API for several scenarios makes
# the second scenario pay for the first one's spending -- which reads as flaky app behaviour
# and is not. One process (and one data directory) per run is what makes the result repeatable.
#
# Usage:  scripts/probe-fresh.sh [scenario|all]
#         scripts/probe-fresh.sh all        # the whole probe: 199 checks
#         scripts/probe-fresh.sh learn      # one scenario (learn|diagnose|proposals|...)
#
# Ports 8010/3001 are used so a running dev pair on 8000/3000 is left alone. Needs a production
# build in frontend/.next (`npm run build`); the script says so instead of failing obscurely.
#
# The API runs with ADAPT_RATE_LIMIT_MULTIPLIER set (10 by default, override with
# PROBE_RATE_LIMIT_MULTIPLIER). That is the probe's own advice for walking the whole suite: one
# IP making a term's worth of traffic in half a minute otherwise spends the per-IP bucket, and
# screens get judged while the limiter is holding them -- a paced write then reads as a broken
# button ("timed out waiting for the resume notice"), and security checks expecting 401/403 get
# 429 instead. The limiter itself is still verified, at the real ceiling, by
# `scripts/failure_matrix_check.py` (which wants default limits) and by the probe's own flood
# check, which reads the bucket width from `GET /api/v1/quotas` before flooding it.
