/**
 * The subject round (§6): resolving a topic, the plan it produces, the round itself, and the
 * subject map it seals into.
 *
 * This module is the only place the subject screen talks to `/subjects/*` and `/topics/resolve`,
 * for the same reason `api.ts` is the only place anything talks to the backend at all: the CSRF
 * header, the error shape and the mock flag are handled once, there.
 *
 * Two honesty rules from the backend are load-bearing here and are *not* re-decided in the
 * browser:
 *
 * * A skill the round did not test arrives with `status: "not_measured"`, `score: null` and
 *   `n: 0`. Nothing in this file converts that into a zero, a percentage or an empty bar — the
 *   screen greys it out and says "not measured yet", which is a different claim.
 * * Every payload that shows a skill set carries `reason` ("this topic leans on these four").
 *   The screen renders it wherever the skills are rendered; it never invents its own.
 *
 * `?mock=1`: `mock.ts` is the shared fixture table and is not this module's to extend, so the
 * fixtures for these endpoints live below, next to the shapes they imitate. They are *recorded
 * shapes* — the calculus and government plans are the sentences the real service produces —
 * and the small state machine under them exists so the round can be clicked through with no
 * backend at all. The layout banner already says the whole app is mocked; nothing here
 * pretends a fixture answer was measured.
