 * acquire a dependency on the fetch layer that reads it. The live half — reading the
 * server's answer and writing a skip — is ``./journey.ts``.
 *
 * The ids are the frozen contract and the order is the path. Nothing here may reorder
 * them, and nothing anywhere should write the sequence out a second time: one path with
 * two ideas of "step 4" is how a learner ends up asked to do work twice.
