# ADAPT web

Next 15 (App Router) and React 19, one client tree per screen, Tailwind 4, and no data layer of
its own: every screen talks to the FastAPI backend through `src/lib/api.ts`, which is the only file
allowed to know what a session cookie, a CSRF token and the `/api/v1` prefix are.

```bash
npm ci
npm run host         # recommended for using/sharing the app: build, then run both servers
npm run dev          # for editing code: API + Next development server, shared on Wi-Fi
npm run dev:web      # frontend only, for a separately managed API
npm run build && npm run start   # the same server, production build
```

## Three-game demo

Share **`/demo`** for the short pitch flow, not the full `/baseline` mind check. One consent action
creates a passwordless guest and opens three phone-friendly games; each answer selects the next
challenge from the validated plan, and the final screen shows the three results, the two actual
adaptations and a next step. The fixed `DEMO` sticker stays on every screen. The full sidebar,
voice controls, sign-in form and opening sequence do not appear on this route.

The real path uses `POST /api/v1/students`, `POST /api/v1/tests/plan`, three
`POST /api/v1/tests/grade` calls and one `POST /api/v1/tests/evidence` call. Preparation is bounded
at eight seconds. A slow, refused or unusable plan opens the built-in games instead; that path is
labelled on the analysis and does not pretend the run was saved. The AI/local-content fallback still
belongs to the API — the browser fallback is the last resort, not a replacement tutor.

With the web app and API running, `npm run test:e2e:demo` drives fresh phone and desktop contexts
through all three games, checks the analysis and evidence writes, and repeats the phone run with the
plan request deliberately delayed beyond the fallback bound and then refused. It fails if any run exceeds two minutes, overflows horizontally,
loses the demo sticker or produces an uncaught browser error.

**For smooth page switching, use `npm run host`.** It builds all routes before starting both
servers, so the first click on a section does not wait for development compilation. Stop any
running dev server before switching modes: both use `.next`. Startup takes the build time;
normal navigation then uses the production build. `npm run dev` is still the editing workflow.
Both commands use the existing Wi-Fi supervisor and stop both servers with Ctrl+C.

`npm run dev` uses `dev.mjs` to find the repository's `.venv` and run `adapt host --dev`.
Install the backend once from the repository root with
`.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e "./backend[dev]"` (create `.venv` first if needed).
It upgrades the database before seeding, starts both servers, prints a LAN address, and
stops both on Ctrl+C or if either service exits. Next runs in development mode without a
production build. The exact detected Wi-Fi IP is added to the API trust list and the Next
HMR allowlist; no wildcard LAN trust is added. The existing room launcher raises rate limits
for shared-Wi-Fi traffic for these processes only, as reported in its banner.

Use `npm run dev -- --ip <wifi-ip>` if VPN/interface detection picks the wrong address,
`PORT=3001 npm run dev` for a different web port, or `ADAPT_PYTHON=/path/to/python` to
choose a Python environment. Other devices must be on the same network and your firewall
must allow the web port. The microphone on a phone requires HTTPS; `--tunnel` is opt-in.

`npm run dev:web` and `npm run start` still run the frontend only. For a mock-only preview,
use `ADAPT_API=offline npm run dev:web` and open `http://localhost:3000/?mock=1`.

`server.mjs` is not `next dev`. It is a small Node server that serves Next and proxies `/api/*`,
`/healthz` and the `Upgrade /ws/voice` handshake to the backend, so the browser only ever talks to
one origin. It rewrites `Host` to the API's own address while forwarding — which is why the API's
untrusted-host refusal never meets a learner's LAN address, and why `adapt host` can serve a room
without trusting a subnet — and it forwards a WebSocket `101` **header for header**, so an
extension the backend negotiated (permessage-deflate) is not silently dropped on the way back.
`PORT` / `HOST` move the listener; **`ADAPT_API`** moves the backend (default
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`; `ADAPT_API=offline` starts the interface with nothing behind it, and every
screen has to say so rather than spinning). For a frontend-only setup, copy
`.env.local.example` to `.env.local`; the custom Node front door explicitly loads that file and
also accepts the frontend-safe allowlisted values from the repository root `.env`. It never loads
provider credentials into the Node process. Nothing in `src/` reads `process.env` — browser code
that did would ship `undefined` — and `player.test.mjs` fails the build if engine code starts naming
a host.

## Entry, home, and subject outlines

* The welcome cover exists in the initial HTML. The app underneath is hidden/inert until it
  finishes; storage failure fails open rather than trapping someone at the welcome sentence.
* `SessionGate` does not mount protected pages or the sidebar while signed out. The floating
  consent/login card cannot be dismissed by Escape or clicking outside. Decline keeps it locked.
* Registration and guest creation store the explicit analytics choice and keep model sharing off.
  Successful authentication returns the profile directly; older session reads cannot overwrite it.
* With no saved baseline history, entry routes to `/baseline`. Once a learner has started a
  baseline (even if unfinished), subsequent sign-ins go to Home. The dashboard offers resume links
  instead of silently restarting the check. Existing signed-in sessions can navigate normally.
* Home reads real progress, due reviews and owned unfinished lesson/baseline/subject runs. An
  empty or unavailable result is labelled, not replaced by sample metrics.
* Subject round has a required subject and optional specific topic, then a reviewable **assessment
  outline**. The checked skills determine the saved round. Comments are stored in its encrypted
  plan and displayed on resume; comments do not automatically rewrite the outline or its content.

Regression walk (against either running mode):

```bash
npm run probe -- --only home,settings,navigation,subject-outline
```

This uses hydrated pages under jsdom, including delayed navigation, guest entry and a returning
login. It does not establish how the interface paints on a real phone; check that on your Wi-Fi.

## Checks

| command | what it proves |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | `node ../scripts/check-contract.mjs && tsc --noEmit`. The contract check reads both sides as *source* — no server, no key, no network: every path the frontend calls exists in the API; `?mock=1` has a fixture for each; route modules export only what Next allows; no hard-coded origin, no `process.env` in browser code, no key material; `/ws/voice` really is proxied; `allowedDevOrigins` covers `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` and the preview domain; and the sim modules, the stage registry and the mock's kinds agree on which scene kinds exist. |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit`. |
| `npm run test:engine` | `node --test src/lib/engine/*.test.mjs` — the player's rules (gate, clamping, timing, reduce-motion) plus two source assertions over `player.ts`, `types.ts` and `components/scenes/*`. |
| `npm run test:dev` | launcher interpreter selection, command forwarding, and missing-backend setup guidance. |
| `npm run test:server` | `node --test server.test.mjs`: the launcher itself — `ADAPT_API=offline` must refuse with a 503 and keep serving the UI (on its own port and its own output directory), a request carrying a LAN `Host` must reach the API as `127.0.0.1`, and an upgrade must come back with the `101`'s own headers intact. |
| `npm run probe` | jsdom driving the real pages against a running dev server + API: click, type, answer, reload, then compare what the screen says with what the API says. `--only diagnose,lesson` and `--base http://host:port` are the two knobs. |
| `npm run probe:mock -- --only lesson` | the same lesson screen on `?mock=1`, asserting the things the mock *can* honestly show — and that it touches no `/api/v1` endpoint at all. |

The probe creates a throwaway learner through `POST /api/v1/students` (waiting out the signup limit
rather than tripping it), so it needs a live API and a live dev server, and it never reuses a real
learner's rows. `PROBE_FIRST_ITEM_KIND=<kind>` pins which item placement starts on — several
scenarios walk a sequence whose length depends on the answer pattern, so without it a fresh database
can send the tour down a different branch (this is the flakiness `docs/AUDIT.md` F11 recorded, and
the reason a full-suite number is quoted with the flag it was taken with).

## Origins, hydration, and two traps worth knowing

`next.config.mjs` sets `allowedDevOrigins`. To Next's host check `127.0.0.1` is **not** an alias of
`localhost`: leave it out and a page loaded by IP gets its HTML and its CSS, has its `/_next/*`
chunks refused, and paints a *complete-looking* screen whose buttons do nothing — because React never
hydrated. Add whatever a tunnel hands you with `ADAPT_DEV_ORIGIN=https://host,another` (comma
separated); `check-contract.mjs` fails if the three origins above ever disappear.

Two operational traps, both paid for:

* **Do not run `npm run build` while `npm run dev` is serving.** Both use `.next`; a production build
  under a live dev server drops it mid-flight and every page answers 500 with
  `Could not find the module … in the React Client Manifest` until `rm -rf .next` and a restart. When a
  probe run suddenly reports `Resource was not loaded. Status: 500`, look here first. The way to have
  both is a second output directory: `ADAPT_NEXT_DIST=.next-build npm run build` (the same knob
  `server.test.mjs` uses so it never disturbs a running preview).
* **A page that paints is not a page that works.** Dev-mode React under jsdom will happily render
  markup for a component that never hydrated, which is why the probe's checks act (click, answer,
  reload) instead of counting nodes, and why the contract check treats an unhydrated origin as a
  failure rather than a cosmetic detail.

## The lesson screen

`src/app/lesson/` is the interactive engine: a catalogue of scenes, a run opened against
`POST /api/v1/lessons/open`, a stage that draws the backend's own frame, a prediction panel that
grades through `sims/*`, a variables panel whose edit produces *a new scene the server derived*, and
a review that refuses to call itself a grade. The rules — what blocks advancing, how long a caption
stays up, why reduce-motion stops autoplay, what is a row and what is state — are documented in
[`../docs/ENGINE.md`](../docs/ENGINE.md), and `src/lib/engine/player.ts` is the only place they live.

Three things a reviewer of this directory should keep in mind:

* `src/lib/mock.ts` is a **review** surface, not a second backend. It cannot store a run, so in mock
  mode there is no resume, no evidence count, and no derived scene in the list — `probe:mock`
  asserts that absence rather than pretending, and the red banner says it on screen.
* A scene kind this build cannot draw still plays: `components/scenes/index.tsx` routes it to
  `UnknownStage`, which shows the frame's narration and its state values and says the picture is
  missing. Nothing is invented to fill the gap, and the contract check is what keeps the set of
  drawn kinds equal to the set the engine computes.
* `stages.tsx` renders frame text as text nodes only — no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, ever — because
  scene narration is authored content. `test:engine` reads the file and fails if that changes.

## What the summary line tells you

The last line prints the number of API calls the harness itself made (a full walk: about 110, plus
whatever each page fetches on its own) and, if the app's limiter paced any of them, says so with the
bucket sizes: `ip` sustains 120/min and learner creation 6/min, and the suite mints a dozen
accounts, so two walks started back to back can cross a window. That is the app working as
designed; the knob the API itself names is `ADAPT_RATE_LIMIT_MULTIPLIER`. A run that fails at a
*different* check each time, with the limiter line absent, is not pacing -- it is a finding.

## Closed: the diagnostic walk selection loss (`numeric-state-reset`)

`diagnose` previously failed its submit checks intermittently (~1 in 10 runs) while every API call
answered 200. Two separate React effects were wiping the learner's in-progress answer:

1. Both `/diagnose` and `/learn` now blank only a screen that is still empty (`painted` ref), so a
   re-running load effect never unmounts a question card mid-answer.
2. `src/components/question.tsx` previously cleared `picked`, `typed`, `teach` and `hintState`
   inside a passive `useEffect([item.id, item.hint_count])`. When the probe (or a fast learner)
   typed into the newly mounted `<input>` inside the commit→effect window, the passive effect fired
   afterwards and wiped the input back to `""`. `Question` now resets its per-item state
   synchronously during render using a derived `shownKey` (`${item.id}|${item.hint_count ?? 0}`),
   loads in-progress drafts from `src/lib/drafts.ts`, and keys `startedItemIdRef` by `item.id`
   without mutating refs during render (24/24 checks pass on `bash scripts/probe-fresh.sh diagnose`).

## `npm run test:server` snapshots and restores `tsconfig.json`

Next adds `<the distDir it was given>/types/**/*.ts` to `tsconfig.json`'s `include` whenever it
starts a project it has not seen at that path. `server.test.mjs` snapshots `tsconfig.json` before
spawning `server.mjs`, restores it inside `stopAndSweep`, and asserts that `tsconfig.json` is
byte-identical after each test.
