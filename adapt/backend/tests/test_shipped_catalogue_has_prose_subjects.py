"""The shipped catalogue carries prose subjects, not only the maths bank.

`test_subject_agnostic_content.py` proves the *paths* — segmentation, generic visual templates,
quotability checking — on its own fixtures. That is not the same claim as "you can open a history
concept in this app": the seeded catalogue was twenty mathematics topics, so in the running
product "any subject" was still only an assertion about code.

These two tests close that gap on the catalogue that actually ships:

* the bank contains a history and a biology topic, each with source notes and no arithmetic in
  them anywhere;
* every one of their items is gradeable right and wrong through the real grading path (a typed
  answer keyed to a word in the notes, a choice question, a teach-back, and a worked example that
  is never scored);
* the concept-versions path produces the three teaching versions and a matched question pair from
  those notes, with the quotability check passing and nothing left unverified.
