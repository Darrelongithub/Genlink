"""Wiring between the AI modules and the rest of the app, tested without an API key.

Every LLM call path is skipped in CI because ``conftest.py`` pops the Gemini key: the app
is designed to fall back to local rules, which is the right product decision and the wrong
testing one. The consequence is that a call site can be broken in a way no test reaches --
and five of them were.

``redact_payload`` returns ``(sanitized, dropped, kinds)``. Five call sites unpacked two:

    safe, dropped = redact_payload({"q": user}, max_chars=7000)

which raises ``ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)`` on the first request
that reaches it. Every LLM path in the app -- proposals (AI 1), the tutor reply, the
teach-back commentary, generated practice -- would have raised the moment a key was
configured, and nothing in 195 tests would have noticed. The first test here is the one
that notices; the second exercises the path that a learner actually sees.
