"""Round 2, Phase G: the frozen contracts lined up over HTTP.

The whole point of the integration: a typed topic goes in at ``POST /api/v1/content/prepare``,
comes back as a validated Pack (built by Phase B's service, driven here by a scripted fake
model), and Phase C's three lesson moments then teach **that Pack** — over real HTTP routes,
through the real app, with the fake injected only where the app assembles its model client
(``services.ai2.llm``). Before the Phase G seam fix in ``routes/lesson.py``, the middle of this
chain was broken: the lesson routes rebuilt packs with ``force_simple=True`` and could never
see a prepared Pack.
