"""The one table this package owns: a learner's explicit answer about a stage.

Declared here rather than in ``db/models.py`` for the same reason the subject round's
four tables live in ``adapt/subjects/models.py``: that file is a shared surface, and a
round-2 workstream adding columns to it is how two workstreams collide. ``db/models.py``
imports this module at the bottom, which is what puts ``journey_stages`` on
``Base.metadata`` so ``create_all`` builds it and ``alembic check`` can see it.

Why a table at all, when every stage is derived? Because two things cannot be derived:
a **skip** (nothing was recorded because the learner waved it through) and an explicit
"I have done this" for work that happened outside the app. Both are the learner's own
statements. Everything else stays derived, and :mod:`adapt.journey.state` prefers the
evidence when the two disagree -- a stage that says ``skipped`` and then has a sealed
baseline behind it is ``done``.
