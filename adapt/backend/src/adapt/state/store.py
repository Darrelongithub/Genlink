"""``LearnerState`` — the typed service layer over the one store.

Everything the three intelligences share goes through this object. It owns:

* the **append-only evidence log** (idempotent by event id, weighted by source);
* the **versioned derived model** (immutable rows, optimistic advance, rebuildable from the log);
* the **content registry** (addressed by content hash, validated by code, reused by id);
* **teaching memory** (what was already said, shown or asked);
* **lesson plans and deliveries** (with the model version and content ids they were built from);
* **session state** (topic, block, pace, fatigue, the plan in force).

Every write states which module is writing and is checked against the permission matrix. Every read
that a module builds from returns an immutable :class:`~adapt.state.snapshot.LearnerSnapshot`, so a
lesson is planned from one consistent view rather than from a moving set of rows.
