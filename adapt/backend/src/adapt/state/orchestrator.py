"""The Orchestrator: one deterministic turn cycle, and a re-plan that never restarts a lesson.

Round brief §2A, steps 1–5:

1. **Ingest** events into the evidence log (idempotent).
2. **Model**: AI 1 (deterministic maths plus constrained model suggestions) produces a new
   ``model_version``.
3. **Content**: AI 2 ensures the next concept's pack exists — a cache hit by id, generating and
   validating only on a miss.
4. **Plan**: AI 3 builds the lesson plan from model version *N* and the pack ids.
5. **Deliver**: render, and record the delivery with its provenance.

Two properties matter more than the code here:

* **Determinism.** Every step is a call to a deterministic function of the store's contents plus the
  events handed in. Nothing in the cycle reads a clock, a random number or the network except where
  that is the point (a genuinely new content pack), and the model step is a pure fold over the log.
* **The plan is not the lesson.** Re-planning produces a *new plan* and supersedes the old one; the
  session state (which block the learner is on, what they have already seen) is untouched, so a
  re-plan mid-lesson changes what comes next and not what is on screen.

The Orchestrator imports the AIs. The AIs import the store. No AI imports another AI — that is the
direction the brief asks for, and ``tests/test_state_foundation.py`` asserts it by parsing the
modules.
