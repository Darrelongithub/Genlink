"""Turning the words a learner typed into a subject, a topic and a level hint (§6.3 step 1).

The learner names a topic in free text. Something has to decide what they meant, and the brief gives
that job to AI 2 with code holding the decision: ``POST /topics/resolve`` normalises, and everything
downstream (which skills are rated, which prerequisite chain is built) reads the normalised result
rather than the raw string.

There is no model key in this sandbox, so the path that actually runs is the deterministic one, and
it is built to be good rather than to be a stub:

* **Level words are lifted out first.** "GCSE calculus" is the topic *calculus* at level *gcse*.
  Matching the whole string would miss the topic, and matching without stripping would leave a level
  word inside a title that is then shown back to the learner as their subject.
* **The shipped curriculum is a first-class match.** ``assessment.bank.TOPICS`` is a real authored
  prerequisite graph of 22 topics with real graded items. A learner who types "adding fractions"
  lands on ``fraction_add`` and the ladder can then run on the bank's own graph and items instead of
  a parallel invented set — so ``source="curriculum"`` is a better outcome than ``"authored"``, not
  a worse one.
* **Nothing is invented.** If the text matches nothing, the answer says so (``source="unresolved"``)
  and the skill list falls back to the universal mechanics, labelled. Guessing a subject from a
  string would produce a confident plan for the wrong subject, which is the failure §13 forbids.

A model may refine the answer when one is configured (``resolve_topic(..., llm=…)``); its family and
level are validated against the same closed lists, and a refinement that names an unknown family is
discarded rather than trusted.
