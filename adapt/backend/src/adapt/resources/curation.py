"""Master prompt 4 -- resource curation: pick for *this* learner, cite only what exists.

The search layer (``adapt.resources``) already fans out to OpenAlex, arXiv, Open
Library and YouTube, ranks and de-duplicates. What prompt 4 adds on top is the
curation judgement: of the results, which four are worth *this* learner's time,
and a one-line "why" addressed to them (<=140 chars), intro-level when mastery is
low and primary/academic when it is high.

The deterministic path here is not a stub: ranking has already happened, so the
rule pick is "the ranked results, with a level-appropriate sentence each". The
model path is the upgrade, and it is held to the same rule as every other model
surface in this app -- guardrail 4 ("do not invent citations") is structural here:
a pick whose ``url`` is not one of the results it was handed is refused wholesale,
because a curator that can add a plausible-looking URL is a curator that can
recommend something nobody ever wrote.
