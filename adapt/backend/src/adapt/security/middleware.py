"""HTTP middleware: headers, host/origin checks, body caps, rate limits, audit hook.

The blueprint requires HTTPS for the demo "not merely assumed because the app uses
a web framework", so this module *enforces* the transport posture rather than
describing it:

* ``TrustedHostMiddleware`` rejects a Host header that is not the local dev host,
  the tunnel host, or an explicitly allowed extra -- which also blocks the classic
  host-header poisoning/redirect trick against a tunnel.
* ``SecurityHeadersMiddleware`` sets CSP (no inline scripts, no third-party
  origins), HSTS when TLS is on, nosniff, referrer and permissions policy
  (camera/microphone restricted to the app origin -- the mic is used by voice),
  and frame denial.
* ``LimitsMiddleware`` caps request size and rate before any handler runs.
