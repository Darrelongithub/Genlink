"""Exact symbolic checking for algebra and calculus keys (§7.3).

§7.3 asks maths and computational content to be verified *by computing*: "extend
``assessment/generated.py`` with a symbolic checker, e.g. SymPy, for calculus and algebra; keep the
existing ``safe_arithmetic`` approach for simple items."

**Why this is not SymPy.** The brief says "e.g.", and the choice is argued rather than assumed:
SymPy is a 60 MB dependency whose value here is breadth — symbolic integration, matrices, physics
units — and what the content engine needs is *depth on one class*: exact equivalence and
differentiation for polynomials and rational functions, which is what school algebra and the
differentiation half of school calculus are made of. A dependency that size has to be importable on
a phone-hosted demo and on every cold start, so a 300-line checker over exact rationals wins unless
breadth is needed. If a later phase wants integration or trigonometric identities, that is the point
to add SymPy — and this module's public surface (:func:`equivalent`, :func:`differentiate`,
:func:`solve`, :func:`evaluate`) is deliberately the shape SMT/SymPy-style callers would want, so
swapping the engine is a one-file change rather than a rewrite.

**Exactness.** Everything is :class:`fractions.Fraction` arithmetic. There is no epsilon anywhere in
this file. Binary floating point is *not* the model: a stem that says ``0.1`` means one tenth, not
the nearest double to it, so ``0.1 + 0.2`` and ``0.3`` are the same number here. That is the school
reading, and it is the reading under which a learner who types 0.3 is right. It also means this
checker will *disagree* with a naive float comparison -- which is a feature when the alternative is
marking 0.3 wrong.

**Two methods, and they must agree.** :func:`equivalent` first canonicalises both sides to a
rational function and compares exactly; when that says "not equal" it also probes the *difference*
at rational sample points, because a canonicaliser bug and a genuinely wrong key look identical from
one method.
A candidate is accepted only if both methods agree — the same "second independent pass" rule §7.3
applies to non-computational content.

**What it refuses.** Anything outside the grammar raises :class:`SymbolicError` with a reason, and
callers are expected to fall back to ``unverified`` (never to accept). ``sin``, ``log``, matrices,
inequalities and non-integer powers are all refused by name, because silently treating an
unsupported function as zero is how a checker becomes a liar.
