"""Segmented teaching: short steps, each with a check — never a truncation.

What this replaces: "split long explanations into short segments" was implemented
as ``" ".join(words[:max_words]) + "…"``. That is not segmenting, it is cutting:
the last step routinely lost the sentence that carried the point, and there was no
check between steps, so a learner could read nothing, learn nothing, and be
recorded as having read an explanation.

The rule here is the one the evidence is about (Tabbers et al. 2004; Mayer &
Anderson 1991): the *whole* text, in self-contained steps, with a question after
each step that is answerable only from that step. Nothing is dropped to fit a
budget. If a caller insists on a word budget, the budget decides how many steps
there are — not which sentences survive — and :attr:`Segmented.dropped` is empty
by construction (a test asserts it).
