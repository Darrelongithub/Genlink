"""Completion of the authored bank: every item gets a worked example and three graded hints.

Two defects this closes, both found by using the app rather than by reading it:

* ``GET /items/{id}/worked-example`` returned ``steps: []`` for 24 of the 63 shipped items —
  and the explanation then said *"copy the first line of the example"* about an example that
  did not exist. The rule now is: **the app never refers to an example it cannot show.** Every
  item has one, authored or derived here, and every derived one is checked against the item's
  own answer key before it is shown.
* Hints fell back to a single generic sentence ("Write down the single fact the question is
  asking for…") for 17 items with no hints and 39 with fewer than three. A hint that could be
  pasted onto any question teaches nothing about *this* question.

**How the derived content stays true.** Nothing here is invented prose. Each generated step is
built from material the item already carries — its own stem, the distractor reasons its author
wrote (``why_wrong``), its rubric concepts, and its answer key (``answer_spec``) — and then
verified:

* the expression in a numeric item's rule is evaluated here and the last step has to carry the
  same number;
* an option item's final step has to quote the option the key marks correct;
* placeholders (``{a}``) may never survive into anything a learner reads;
* the last step may not claim a value that disagrees with the key.

:func:`verify_example` is the check, and it runs on every path that serves an example — the
bank seed, the worked-example route and ``scripts/teaching_quality_eval.py`` — so a hand-written
item that contradicts itself is caught by the same gate as a derived one.

This is the *deterministic* half of AI 2's content engine (section 7 of the brief). Model-written
content goes through the same verification before it is stored; it does not get a pass.
