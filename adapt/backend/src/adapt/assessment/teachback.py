"""Teach-back grading: a fixed three-point checklist, evidence quoted, text as data.

What this replaces: ``rubric.required_concepts`` with synonym sets, matched by
``any(needle in words or needle in lower)``. Two failure modes were structural, not
occasional:

* **listing passes.** Three required words written in a row — no sentence, no
  relation, no understanding — scored 1.0, because each word was present;
* **a good paraphrase fails.** A learner who writes the idea in their own words and
  never uses the rubric's word scored 0, because the rubric was the *only* thing
  that could match.

So the unit of grading is a **checklist item of at most three points**, and a point
is made only when the learner's own words carry it. Three rules do the work:

1. **Evidence is a quote.** A point is met only by a span of the learner's text that
   contains the idea *and* enough surrounding words to be a statement about it
   (``MIN_EVIDENCE_WORDS``). A bare word is not a statement.
2. **One span, one point.** The same sentence cannot pay for two points.
3. **Text is data.** Instruction-shaped text inside an answer is an answer, never an
   instruction — see :func:`as_data`, which is applied to anything a model sees.

The rule grader here is deterministic and needs no model. A model may be asked for a
second opinion, but its output is only accepted when it is *structurally* valid and
its quotes are verbatim (see :func:`accept_model_grading`); otherwise the rule result
stands and the rejection is recorded, because a grader that silently accepts a
creative response is a grader that can be talked into a pass.

Master prompt 3 (the six-prompt set in ``adapt-web-application-prompts.zip``, pinned
verbatim as ``adapt.ai.prompts.TEACHBACK_GRADER_SYSTEM``) adds the learner-facing
half of that contract: whatever grades a teach-back also returns
``score`` (0..1), ``feedback`` (<= :data:`FEEDBACK_MAX_CHARS` chars, second person,
kind and specific) and ``misconceptions``. Both paths carry those keys: the rule
grader composes its own feedback from the checklist (:func:`feedback_for`) and never
claims a misconception it cannot quote, and an accepted model judgement may replace
the feedback and name misconceptions -- but the *score* still comes from the quoted
points, never from the model's own number.
