"""ADAPT's seed curriculum: a real prerequisite graph + parametric items.

Subject choice is deliberate: key-stage-3/4 maths is where BKT, worked examples and
spaced retrieval have the densest evidence base, and where "the answer is a number"
means grading can be objective rather than vibes-based.

Every item is either:

* **parametric** -- ``stem_template`` + ``answer_spec.ranges`` + ``answer_spec.formula``
  (the same variable/expression model Numbas uses), so :func:`adapt.ai.local_tutor.render_variant`
  can generate a fresh version with a recomputed answer. This is what makes
  "adaptive practice" real rather than a shuffled list; and
* **fixed** -- a specific stem (visual/teach-back/worked-example items), where a
  number would not be the point.

Teach-back items carry a ``rubric.required_concepts`` list with synonym sets, so
"explain it in your own words" is scored on ideas covered and never on eloquence.

        "In a chain like 12 - 5 - 4 the operations have equal rank, so they are done strictly left to "
        "right: 12 - 5 = 7, then 7 - 4 = 3. Each minus sign belongs to the number after it, so nothing "
        "is ever 'moved across'; if you get 12 - 1 you have added the 5 back by accident. Multiplying "
        "and dividing come before adding and subtracting, so in 7 + 3 x 2 - 1 the 3 x 2 is worked out "
        "first and the rest is then read left to right. Check a chain by running it backwards."
    ),
    "fractions_intro": (
        "A fraction names a part of a whole. The denominator says how many equal parts the whole is cut "
        "into; the numerator says how many of those parts you are talking about. The parts must be equal or "
        "the fraction does not mean anything. Writing a fraction is division: 3/4 means 3 divided by 4."
    ),
    "equivalent_fractions": (
        "Two fractions are equivalent when they name the same point on the number line, even though the "
        "digits differ. Multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the same number, as long as it is not zero, cannot "
        "change the value, because you have multiplied by 1. Cancelling down divides both by a common "
        "factor, for the same reason. To compare fractions, rewrite them over a common denominator."
    ),
    "fraction_add": (
        "You can only add or subtract like units, so fractions need a common denominator first. Choose the "
        "lowest common multiple of the denominators, scale each fraction up to it, then add or subtract the "
        "numerators and keep that denominator. Never add denominators: that would change the size of the part."
    ),
    "fraction_mult": (
        "Multiplying fractions needs no common denominator: multiply the numerators, multiply the "
        "denominators, then cancel. 'Of' means multiply, so 2/5 of 15 is 2/5 x 15. Dividing by a fraction "
        "is multiplying by its reciprocal, because dividing by a/b asks how many a/b fit into the amount."
    ),
    "decimals": (
        "Each place value is ten times the one on its right, and that keeps going past the decimal point: "
        "tenths, hundredths, thousandths. A decimal is a fraction whose denominator is a power of ten, so "
        "0.37 is 37/100. Shifting the point multiplies or divides by ten; it does not change the digits."
    ),
    "percentages": (
        "Percent means per hundred, so a percentage is a fraction over 100 and a decimal divided by 100. "
        "To find a percentage of a quantity, convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply. A decrease of "
        "p percent is multiplying by (1 - p/100); repeated percentage change multiplies each time, which is "
        "why a 10% rise then a 10% fall does not return you to the start."
    ),
    "ratio": (
        "A ratio compares quantities in the parts they are made of, and it simplifies like a fraction. To "
        "share an amount in the ratio a:b, add the parts, divide the total by that number to find one part, "
        "then scale up. Equivalent ratios come from multiplying every term by the same number."
    ),
    "negative_numbers": (
        "On a number line, subtracting moves left and adding moves right, and that stays true below zero. "
        "The error to avoid is treating the minus sign as a separator: -3 - 5 is two moves left, giving -8. "
        "Multiplying or dividing two negatives gives a positive because the direction reverses twice."
    ),
    "order_of_operations": (
        "Brackets first, then powers, then multiplication and division left to right, then addition and "
        "subtraction left to right. Multiplication and division have equal rank, so you work strictly left to "
        "right; writing a fraction bar is an implicit bracket around the numerator and denominator."
    ),
    "collecting_terms": (
        "Like terms have the same variables to the same powers, so they count the same thing and can be "
        "added. x and x squared are not like terms. The coefficient is the number in front, including its "
        "sign: in 3a - 5b the second term is -5b, not 5b."
    ),
    "linear_equations": (
        "Solving means finding the value that makes both sides equal, and you keep equality by doing the same "
        "operation to both sides. Undo operations in reverse order: brackets first, then the constant, then "
        "the coefficient. Check by substituting back into the original equation."
    ),
    "rearranging": (
        "Rearranging is solving with the subject as the unknown, so the same legal moves apply. Collect the "
        "terms containing the subject on one side, factorise it out, then divide by the remaining bracket. You "
        "cannot cancel a term that is part of a sum; factorise first."
    ),
    "graphs_lines": (
        "In y = mx + c, m is the gradient (change in y over change in x) and c is the y intercept. Parallel "
        "lines share a gradient; perpendicular lines have gradients whose product is -1. A point lies on the "
        "line exactly when its coordinates satisfy the equation."
    ),
    "indices": (
        "A power counts repeated multiplication of a base. Multiplying powers of the same base adds indices, "
        "dividing subtracts them, and a power of a power multiplies them. Anything to the power zero is 1, "
        "and a negative index means reciprocal: x^-2 = 1/x^2."
    ),
    "standard_form": (
        "Standard form writes a number as A x 10^n where 1 <= A < 10, which makes size comparisons easy. A "
        "large number gets a positive n and a small one a negative n. Multiply the A values and add the "
        "indices, then readjust so A is back in range."
    ),
    "statistical_mean": (
        "The mean is the total divided by the count, so it depends on every value and is pulled by outliers. "
        "The median is the middle value in order and resists outliers. The range is largest minus smallest and "
        "describes spread only, never the average."
    ),
    "area_perimeter": (
        "Perimeter is a length, so it is added in units; area counts square units inside, so it multiplies "
        "two lengths. For a triangle, halve the enclosing rectangle. Rearrange the area formula to recover a "
        "missing side rather than memorising a variant."
    ),
    "unit_conversion": (
        "Converting units is multiplying by 1 written as an equivalent pair, such as 100 cm over 1 m, so the "
        "unit you do not want cancels. Squared units need the factor squared; cubic units cubed. Estimate the "
        "answer first to catch a multiply versus divide slip."
    ),
    "history_ww1": (
        "The First World War began in 1914, and no single cause explains it. Two armed camps had "
        "formed in Europe before 1914: the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy, "
        "and the Triple Entente of Britain, France and Russia. The trigger came on 28 June 1914, "
        "when Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated in "
        "Sarajevo. Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia and declared war on 28 July. Alliances then "
        "pulled the larger powers in: Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August and on France on "
        "3 August, and Britain declared war on Germany on 4 August after Germany invaded Belgium. "
        "Historians weigh the causes differently: the alliance system turned a local quarrel into "
        "a European war, militarism meant the plans were ready, and imperialism fed the rivalry."
    ),
    "bio_photosynthesis": (
        "Photosynthesis is how a plant makes its own food. It happens in the chloroplasts, which "
        "contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. The plant takes in carbon dioxide through "
        "small openings in its leaves and water through its roots. Chlorophyll traps light energy, "
        "and that energy is used to join the carbon dioxide and water into glucose, a sugar the "
        "plant uses for growth and which it stores as starch. Oxygen is released as a waste "
        "product of the reaction. The word equation is carbon dioxide plus water, in the presence "
        "of light and chlorophyll, giving glucose plus oxygen. Respiration is the reverse process: "
        "it releases the energy stored in glucose, and it happens in plants all the time, not only "
        "in the dark."
    ),
    "probability": (
        "For equally likely outcomes, probability is favourable outcomes over total outcomes, which is a "
        "fraction between 0 and 1. Multiply by 100 for a percentage. Independent events multiply; 'at least "
