"""The interactive learning engine's API: play a scene, change its variables, predict, ask why.

The division of labour is deliberate and is the whole reason this file stays short:

* the **backend simulation** computes the steps (``learning/sims``);
* a **spec** is data, validated before it is ever stored (``learning/scenespec``), so nothing here
  accepts markup, code, or a "renderer" the server would obey;
* the **player** in the browser is a reducer over the frame list this API hands it once -- play,
  pause, step, scrub and replay cost no requests, so a lesson does not become 56 calls;
* the **position and the predictions** are written back, because "restart must not lose the
  lesson" and "AI 1 gets evidence about what the learner could foresee" are both storage promises.

Every route below belongs to one learner's own rows. There is no endpoint that takes a learner id:
the session cookie decides whose run is opened, refused, or resumed.
