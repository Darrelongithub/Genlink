"""The mind baseline over HTTP (round brief §5).

Five endpoints, each one screen of the flow:

* ``POST /baseline`` — open (or resume) a run.
* ``GET  /baseline/{run_id}`` — what to show next.
* ``POST /baseline/{run_id}/format`` — the pre-game format choice.
* ``POST /baseline/{run_id}/questions`` — the stated questions, in one submit.
* ``POST /baseline/{run_id}/trial`` — answer the task on offer; the reply carries the next one.
* ``POST /baseline/{run_id}/finish`` — seal the run into the mind snapshot (skippable at any point).
* ``GET  /baseline/snapshot`` — the eight factors and the levers, latest or in progress.
* ``GET  /baseline/next-day`` — the codeword re-check for a learner who came back.

The learner owns the run: every route acts on the signed-in student and a run id must belong to
them. That check is one helper (:func:`_owned`) rather than a copy per route, because a
per-route check is how one route ends up missing it.
