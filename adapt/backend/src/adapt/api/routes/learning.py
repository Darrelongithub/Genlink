Every endpoint here is one visible beat of that cycle, and the UI is allowed to be
boring about it: the diagnostic returns items, the client posts the events it
observed, submitting an answer updates the trace, ``/analyze`` produces evidence +
hypotheses + (maybe) a proposal, and ``/journey`` shows the whole thing in order.

Nothing in this file writes ``approved_adaptations``; that only happens in
``routes/adaptations.py`` after the learner answers, which calls the one function in
