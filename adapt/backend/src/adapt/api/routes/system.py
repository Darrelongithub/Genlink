"""Health, capability, budget and privacy status -- the honest-systems screen.

These endpoints exist because the blueprint's guardrails are claims about the
running system ("local inference", "free tiers only", "encrypted at rest", "no
surveillance"), and a claim you can query is a claim a judge can check. Each one
answers with what was *verified now*, not with what the config hopes for: the
voice section reports whether faster-whisper's weights actually load, the database
section reports whether the file header is ciphertext, the quota section reports
today's model spend from the audit table.
