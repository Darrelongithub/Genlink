"""The subject round over HTTP (round brief §6).

The four endpoints the brief names, plus the ones a screen needs to walk a round:

* ``POST /topics/resolve``        — free text to subject, topic and level hint (§6.3 step 1).
* ``GET  /subjects/plan``         — which skills the round tests, which it does not, and why (§6.3).
* ``POST /subjects/ladder/{step}``— one answer on the staircase; the reply carries the next rung (§6.4).
* ``POST /subjects/method-test``  — the pop-up lesson: open it, or score the answers to it (§6.5).
* ``POST /subjects/round``        — open (or resume) a round for a topic.
* ``GET  /subjects/round/{id}``   — what to show next.
* ``POST /subjects/round/{id}/trial`` — answer the skill task on offer.
* ``POST /subjects/round/{id}/finish``— seal the round into a subject map, skippable at any point.
* ``GET  /subjects/snapshot``     — the subject map screen's payload.
* ``GET  /subjects/taxonomy``     — the skill sets themselves, with their version.
* ``GET  /subjects/recheck`` and ``POST /subjects/recheck/{id}`` — the next-day lesson recheck.

**One router, one prefix.** ``/topics/resolve`` is not under ``/subjects``, and ``api/app.py`` is
frozen for this round, so both live on a single router mounted at ``/api/v1`` — one line for the
integrator to add instead of two (see ``docs/AUDIT.md``).

**Errors are the house shape.** ``{"detail": {"error": "<slug>", "message": …}}``, 422 for refused
input, 404 for a run that is not yours *and* for one that does not exist (one message for both, so
probing somebody else's run id learns nothing), 409 for a mutation on a sealed round.

**The learner owns everything here.** The student comes from the session, never from a query
parameter, and every run id is checked against it inside the service.
