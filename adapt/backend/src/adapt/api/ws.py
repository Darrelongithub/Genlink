"""The voice websocket: audio in, VAD endpointing, answer + speech out.

Protocol (one connection per conversation; the endpoint is ``/ws/voice``, advertised by
``GET /api/v1/voice/capabilities`` so the client never hard-codes it):

client -> server
  * binary frame      : one microphone chunk (s16le mono, default 16 kHz; override
                        with the ``sr`` query parameter, e.g. ``sr=48000``)
  * {"t":"text", "text":...}  : typed or browser-dictated input -- same turn path
  * {"t":"listen"}            : push-to-talk: reopen the gate after a reply
  * {"t":"config", ...}       : voice on/off (``voice`` or ``voice_on``), gender,
                        barge-in on/off -> answered by {"t":"config_ack", ...}
  * {"t":"stop"}              : stop speaking right now
  * {"t":"status"} | {"t":"ping"}
server -> client
  * {"t":"hello", "sample_rate_in", "sample_rate_out", "status":{...}}
  * {"t":"state", "state": idle|listening|transcribing|thinking|speaking, "reason"?}
  * {"t":"transcript", "text", "backend", "ms", "note"}   what we heard
  * {"t":"reply", "text", "ms", "meta":{provider,intent,...}}
  * binary frame      : s16le mono speech at ``sample_rate_out`` (Kokoro: 24 kHz)
  * {"t":"tts_chunk", "index", "text"} : which words this audio was
  * {"t":"speak_unavailable", "reason", "text"} : no local TTS -> use browser voice
  * {"t":"error", "where", "detail", "recoverable"}
  * {"t":"throttle", "scope", "retry_after_s", "recoverable"}  : too many frames too fast
  * {"t":"deduped", "reason", "recoverable"}                   : the same frame, twice
  * {"t":"busy", "state", "recoverable"}                       : a turn is already running

Three properties of the real world shaped this file:

1. **Audio never touches disk.** Frames are decoded in memory, transcribed, then
   dropped; only transcripts and turn metrics are stored, and only while the learner
   is using voice.
2. **Interruption has to be designed in, not bolted on.** The read loop keeps
   feeding the VAD while the assistant is talking (the pipeline answers in its own
   task), so sustained speech for ``barge_in_speech_ms`` flips the state and cancels
   the next TTS chunk. Chunked speech is what makes the latency of "stop" one chunk
   instead of one answer.
3. **A browser cannot send an Authorization header on a websocket.** The session
   cookie is the credential, and the same-origin/trusted-host middleware is what
   stops another site from opening the socket on the learner's behalf.
