"""Accounts, onboarding, and the lifecycle of a learning session.

Onboarding here is deliberately *not* a learning-styles questionnaire. The
blueprint asks for a dynamic, evidence-based profile, and the literature is blunt
about the alternative: matching presentation format to a claimed style has no
benefit effect when styles are actually manipulated (Pashler et al. 2008;
Coffield et al. 2004). So onboarding collects things that change the *logistics*
and the *starting point* -- goal, available time, language, voice preference,
whether they want to be pushed -- and leaves "how you learn best" to be measured
from behaviour, with the student approving any persistent change.

The diagnostic is the first "Test" in the loop: it samples topics broadly rather
than deeply, because its job is to place mastery inside a confidence band, not to
grade the learner.
