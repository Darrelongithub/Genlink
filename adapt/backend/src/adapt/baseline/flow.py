"""The baseline flow: which stage comes next, and what happens when the learner stops early.

Round brief §5.1. The order is fixed by the brief (crossword study → vault → machine → locked box →
delayed codewords → the rest) and this module is the only place that order lives.

Two things are worth stating because they are the reason this file exists at all:

* **The stage is derived, never stored as progress.** ``next_step`` reads the trial log and answers
  "what now?", so a learner who closes the tab on game three and returns tomorrow is served game
  three's next task from the same log. There is no cursor to get out of step with the data.
* **Stopping is normal.** A partial baseline is stored with what was measured and everything else
  marked "not measured" (brief §5.2). Nothing here tries to talk the learner out of stopping, and
  nothing invents a value for a game that was never played.
