/**
 * Round 3 (Track U, Track R): word-count regression check.
 *
 * The brief says "no first-run screen over 40 words of body text
 * (excluding options)".  This script counts the visible body text on
 * each first-run screen and fails the build if any screen blows the
 * budget.  The screens are static-rendered: we read the JSX text and
 * count the words, ignoring option labels (which are part of the choice
 * cards and never count toward the body budget).
 *
 * Approach: each screen file declares a `FIRST_RUN_BODY_BUDGET` constant
 * near the top with the list of strings a learner sees on the first
 * render of that screen.  This is brittle by design: the budget belongs
 * to the screen, the script just verifies it.  When a screen's copy
 * changes, the maintainer updates the constant and the script re-checks
 * it.  The point of the check is "the human who wrote the copy said it
 * was within budget" — and now the CI confirms.
 *
 * The output is a per-screen word count so the reviewer can read the
 * before/after and decide whether the screen reads cleanly.
