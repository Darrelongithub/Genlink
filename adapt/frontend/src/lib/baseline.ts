/**
 * The mind baseline, from the browser's side (round brief section 5).
 *
 * The flow is the server's, not this file's: the API answers "what now?" and every screen here
 * renders what came back. That is deliberate -- a cursor kept in the browser is a cursor that can
 * disagree with the trial log, and then a learner who closes the tab is served game one again.
 * So this module is thin on purpose: typed calls, plus the few pure helpers (`offers_coins`,
 * `timers_visible`, `format_range`) that decide presentation and can be unit-tested without a DOM.
 *
 * Two promises the screens must keep, both asserted in the probe rather than only here:
 *
 * * **Stopping is normal.** Every screen has a way to finish now; a partial baseline stores what
 *   was measured and marks the rest "not measured" -- never zero.
 * * **Coins are a question, not a game.** A wager is offered only on scored question tasks, never
 *   on a practice trial, and never when the learner asked for timers off (which is about how the
 *   app behaves, and asking for coins while refusing a clock would be the same pressure in a
 *   different costume).
