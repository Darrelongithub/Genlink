/**
 * ADAPT's front door.
 *
 * One origin for the browser: Next.js serves the app, and `/api/*`, `/healthz` and the
 * `/ws/voice` socket are proxied to the Python backend on the same machine. That means
 * the learner's session cookie is first-party to this origin (no CORS, no cross-site
 * cookie rules to get wrong) and the API never has to expose itself publicly.
 *
 * `ADAPT_API` points at the backend (default http://127.0.0.1:8000). Set
 * `ADAPT_API=offline` to start the UI with the API closed: every call fails, and the
 * app shows what it could not reach instead of pretending.
