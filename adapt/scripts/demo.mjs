/**
 * `node scripts/demo.mjs` — the learner loop, driven from the client side.
 *
 * Why this exists when `adapt demo` already does the same story server-side: the backend
 * demo proves the maths and the gate. This one proves the *contract the browser codes
 * against* — CSRF on the verbs that need it, the exact event body the allowlist accepts,
 * the nested `{item, presentation}` shape of a plan, the 409 you get when a proposal has
 * already been answered. Every one of those has been a real defect at some point, and a
 * server-side test could not see them because they live in the HTTP surface.
 *
 * It is honest by construction: it prints the server's own strings, it never asserts that
 * a proposal must appear, and it says "nothing was proposed" out loud rather than
 * manufacturing a pattern to make the demo look clever.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/demo.mjs                       # against http://127.0.0.1:8000
 *   ADAPT_API=https://host node scripts/demo.mjs
 *   node scripts/demo.mjs --decide accept       # answer the first pending proposal
 *   node scripts/demo.mjs --wrong 4             # miss N answers so a pattern exists
 *   node scripts/demo.mjs --json                # machine-readable summary at the end
 *   node scripts/demo.mjs --as you@example.test  # sign in as an existing learner (keeps its
 *                                               # history, and the pilot seeded for it)

 * the loop is real -- and the two things a demo is most tempted to overstate are printed with
 * their sample size attached:
 *
 *   - the method comparison carries `n` and says "early signal" under eight observations;
 *   - anything from the pre-demo pilot is labelled as pilot data, in the server's own words,
 *     because seeded rows that look like results are how a demo stops being a demo.
 *
 * Voice, the Numbas export and the encryption internals are deliberately *not* walked here:
 * they are real, they are in `docs/`, and a pitch that tries to show all three spends its
 * minutes on plumbing instead of on the thing the product does.
