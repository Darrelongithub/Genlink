# Round 6 crash log

Crawl of 15 routes × 2 viewports × 3 sessions (signed-out, guest, signed-in), plus the rapid tab-switch test.
Generated 153.0.8010.0 · 2026-10-23T12:20:13.261Z

**No crashes found.** Zero console errors, zero uncaught exceptions, zero non-auth 4xx/5xx from the app's own API, zero blank bodies, zero hydration warnings, zero error screens.


## SessionGate / redirect loop

Fixed in `components/chrome.tsx`: the landing gate that rendered “Opening your path…” over every
screen until the URL reached /journey is gone. If the server says who this browser is, the children
render; navigation is navigation's job. The crawl asserts /journey renders without bouncing.

## Rapid tab switch

10 routes × 3 laps at <300ms apart: passed (no freeze, no loop, no error screen).
